When I first started working with John, I was a bit intimidated by his **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** skills.

However, as I continued to work with him, I began to appreciate the depth and breadth of his knowledge.

His expertise in **React** and **Next.js** was invaluable, and his commitment to delivering **high-quality code** was evident in every aspect of the project.
